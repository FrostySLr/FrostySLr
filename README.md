# **Heyaa! Adimas here** 👋

I'm Adimas a.k.a FrostySLr, a Computer Vision and Microcontroller Enthusiast. I really like to learn new technologies and things that are related to tech 💻. Other than that, I do like debugging problems (mostly computer related problems), photography, animes and manga, and games.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning on Data (SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI)
- :indonesia: I'm from Indonesia
